# Legacy Artifacts

This folder stores historical coursework artifacts that were removed from the active project root during the production refactor.

Contents include old notebooks/zips, proposal files, and the original monolithic script.

They are intentionally kept out of the active pipeline to keep the repository resume-ready and maintainable.
